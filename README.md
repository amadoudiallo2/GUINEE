# GUINEE
This is the project main goal is to computerize the different departments of Guinea’s Government to reduce the corruption, reduce the waste of wood, secure the data and get a very near approximate information about every Guinean citizen regardless of his geographic location. This will have a great impact on the country’s economy in the below cited department and a lot of other subdomains. To do so, every country needs a database system and a strong networking and various equipment. The challenge here is to think very critically how to solve that problem and then proceed with the most efficient and less time-consuming technology to apply the algorithm to. An emphasis should be put on the security aspect of these platform because it is a liability issue. That is why collaboration is encouraged. 
These are the main departments that we’re serving for this very beginning of our journey: 
Birth certificates;
The department of passports;
the department of health;
the department of education;
the department of motor vehicles;
The department of defense;
The police; 
etc.
Remember this saying form Nelson Mandela: << It always seems impossible until it’s done >>, it’s always been easier to work as a team.
